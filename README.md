Statistical Representation of Lottery Winning Probability

Simply put, this is a statistical representation of the lottery made for Statistics Class in College. This program is not an
accurate representation, but is still a theoretical representation. 

This program shows the amount of money spent on tickets before winning the jackpot while taking the summation of spent money,
tickets bought, and prize money earned.
